It's still a work in progress

I am currently working on this game when I have freetime from my school work. The idea is to have a base located at a central point on screen. The base is the attacked by different types of alliens. The goal is to last as many rounds as possible. Upgrade your base to survive.

A lot still needs to be implemented. 

I ran the program on a Mac using Xcode
